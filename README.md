# Employee_absenteeism
XYZ is a courier company. 
The company is passing through genuineissue of Absenteeism. 

As it appreciates that human capital plays an important role
in collection, transportation and delivery. 

The company has shared it dataset and requested to 
answer on the following areas:

1. What changes company should bring to reduce the number of absenteeism?
2. How much losses every month can we project in 2011 if same trend of
absenteeism continues?

I have performed analysis on factors that are effecting the absenteeism rate of the workers and designed a model which predicts the absenteeism based on the previous data and made a complete report of the project.
